# dotdotdot Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy” or “Policy”) describes the types of information Amore-Lab Inc. and its affiliates (“Meyou,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) collect and process from and about you.

Except as described in this Privacy Policy, the Policy applies to any and all websites, mobile applications, and any other electronic and/or digital products and/or other services that are made available by Meyou and that link to this Policy, and our offline services (collectively, the “Services”).

By using the Services, you are agreeing to the practices described in this Policy. If you do not agree to the practices described in this Policy, please do not access or use the Services.

Undefined capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Meyou Terms of Service.

**Information We Collect When you access or otherwise use our Services,** we may collect information from you. The types of information we collect depend on how you use our Services. Please note that we need certain types of information to provide the Services to you. If you do not provide us with such information, or if you ask us to delete that information, you may no longer be able to access or use certain Services. The information we collect may include data you directly provide to us, data we obtain automatically from your interactions with our Services, and data we obtain from other sources.

**Information you provide directly to us.** We may collect information directly from you. For example, you may provide us with information when you use the Services, communicate with us, register for an account, subscribe to newsletters, or participate in a promotion. Information you provide directly to us may concern you and others and may include, but is not limited to:

(i) Email address;

(ii) User name;

(iii) Payment information (e.g. through our payment processing vendors);

(iv) Your User Content (as defined in the Terms of Service), such as chat communications, posted images, and shared Characters; and

(v) Contents of communications with us.

You are not required to provide us with such information, but certain features of the Services may not be accessible or available absent the provision of the requested information.

**Information we collect automatically.** We and our third-party vendors, which include ad networks and analytics companies such as Google Analytics, may use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information about the computers or devices (including mobile devices) you use to access the Services. As described further below, we may collect and analyze information including but not limited to (a) browser type; (b) ISP or operating system; (c) domain name; (d) access time; (e) referring or exit pages; (f) page views; (g) IP address; (h) unique device identifiers (e.g. IDFA or Android ID); (i) version of our Services you’re using; and (j) the type of device that you use. We may also track when and how frequently you access or use the Services, including how you engage with or navigate our site or mobile application. We may use this information (including the information collected by our third-party vendors) for analytics (including to determine which portions of the Services are used most frequently and what our users like/do not like), to evaluate the success of any advertising campaigns, and as otherwise described in this Policy.

We and our third-party vendors may use cookies, clear GIFs, pixel tags, and other technologies that help us better understand user behavior, personalize preferences, perform research and analytics, and improve the Services. These technologies, for example, may allow us to tailor the Services to your needs, save your password in password-protected areas, track the pages you visit, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage of our Services. We or our third-party vendors also may use certain of these technologies in emails to our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but your browser may allow you to modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer. If you disable cookies, you may be prevented from taking full advantage of the Services, because the Services may not function properly. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.

When you use the Services, we may collect general location information (such as general location inferred from an IP address).

**Information we collect from other sources.** We may also collect information about you from other parties, such as when you are referred to us by another user. We may also receive information about you from third-party social platforms, such as Facebook or Instagram, when you interact with our social media profiles.

We may also collect information when you connect to your account using an account maintained by a third party, such as a social media account (“Third-Party Account”). The Services may collect information about you from your Third-Party Accounts in accordance with your permissions. When you connect to us through a Third-Party Account like Facebook or Google, we receive information from that third party identifying your account. We collect and store this information and use it to help you connect to the Services. Connecting your account to a Third-Party Account is completely optional, and you will have the opportunity to grant permission when you attempt to connect. You can revoke permission by logging into the Third-Party Account and disconnecting Meyou from there, and through the native applications on your smartphone. We may retain the information we collected previously from you.

**Consent for Marketing Communications and Notifications.** With your explicit consent, we may send you service updates, marketing content, and promotional information through the following methods:

(i) Email

(ii) In-app notifications

(iii) Push notifications

These communications are designed to enhance your experience by informing you about new features, personalized content, and events related to our service.

You can withdraw your consent at any time through the following methods:

(i) Clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any email

(ii) Adjusting your notification preferences in the app under [Settings] > [Notification Settings]

(iii) Contacting our support team at hello@dotdotdot.ai

Please note that transactional or service-related communications (such as changes to our terms or important security updates) may still be sent regardless of your marketing preferences, as they are essential to the operation of the service.

**Item Data and Related Privacy Practices.** You acknowledge and agree to the following practices regarding the collection and handling of item-related data:

(i) We collect information related to the issuance and use of free and paid items—including timestamps, item types, and transaction logs—for purposes such as customer support, fraud prevention, and maintaining service integrity.

(ii) You may access, correct, delete, or object to the processing of your item-related data at any time.

(iii) Paid item data is retained until your account is deleted, unless a longer retention period is required under applicable law.

(iv) We use industry-standard security measures, including TLS encryption, access controls, and audit logging, to protect your data from unauthorized access, misuse, or loss.

**Personal Data Deletion Policy Upon Account Deletion.** When a user deletes their account, all personally identifiable information (PII) associated with the account will be permanently deleted from our systems without delay, except where retention is required by applicable laws or internal policies for legal, security, or operational reasons. This includes, but is not limited to, your email address, name, payment history, and any uploaded content.

Re-registration is not allowed within 30 days of account deletion.

For creators, please note that if another user has already created a chatroom with a character you uploaded, that chatroom will not be deleted. However, no further messages can be sent in that room once your account is deleted.

Some data that has been anonymized or aggregated in a way that it can no longer be linked to an individual may be retained for analytical and service improvement purposes.

If you have any questions about data deletion, please contact us at [support@dotdotdot.chat](mailto:support@dotdotdot.chat)
